1. Create a class named Circle

        private variables:
            radius

        public variable:
            pi

         Encapsulate all the private fields

                 1. radius of the circle can not be zero or negative

         Add a constructor that can set the radius of circle when circle object is created
                 (If the arguments not valid it should not be set to the instances)

         Methods:
             calcArea()
             calcPerimeter()
             toString(): displays the radius, area and perimeter of the circle when the circle object is passed in the print statement

2. Create a class named Square:
        Private variables:
            side

        Encapsulate all the fields

            Condition:
                side of the square should not be negative

        Add a constructor that allows user to set all the fields when the object is created.


        Methods:
            calcArea(): returns the area of square
            calcPerimeter(): returns the perimeter of square
            toString(): can display the side, area, perimeter of square when object is passed in print statement

3. Create a class named Rectangle:
        Private variables:
            width, length

        Encapsulate all the fields
                Conditions:
                    width of the rectangle should not be negative
                    length of the rectangle should not be negative

        Add a constructor that allows user to set all the fields when the object is created.
                (If the arguments not valid it should not be set to the instances)

        Methods:
            calcArea(): returns the area of rectangle
            calcPerimeter(): returns the perimeter of rectangle
            toString(): can display the width, length, area, and perimeter of rectangle when object is passed in print statement

4. Create a custom class named Candy
        private variables:
            brand (String), quantity (int), price (double), hasPeanuts (boolean)

        Encapsulate All the private fields
                (price of candy can not be set to negative)
                (quantity of candy can not be set to zero or negative)

        Add a constructor that allows user to set all the fields when the object is created.
                (If the arguments not valid it should not be set to the instances)

        Extra methods:
            toString():
                if the price is zero, print "free" instead of 0

        5.1 Create a class named CandyFactory
                Create an ArrayList of candies
                Add five objects of candies
                use for each loop to print the brand and price of each candy

5. create a class named Credentials
            Variables:
                username, password

            Encapsulate all the fields
                    (password MUST be a strong password)


            Add a constructor that allows user to set all the fields when the object is created.
                        (If the arguments not valid it should not be set to the instances)

            Methods:
                isStrongPassWord(): takes an argument of string and verify if the given string is strong password, returns boolean
                            Characteristics of strong passwords are:
                                    1. Password MUST be at least have 8 characters long, and should not contain space
                                    2. PassWord should at least contain one letter
                                    3. Password should at least contain one special characters
                                    4. Password should at least contain a digit

                toString()
