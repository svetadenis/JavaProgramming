Practice Tasks

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computer [Inheritance, access modifiers]
	Follow the steps to practice using the concepts and see how they work in the code

	Create a package access.a
	Create a class Computer in package access.a
		define the instance variables with access modifiers:
			os - public
			memory - protected
			brand - default
			has wifi card - private

		create a toString

	Create a class Windows in package access.a
		inherit the Computer class
		make a main method and create a Windows object. Check to see which variables are accessible

	Then make a class Runner in package access.a
		make a main method and create a Windows object. Check to see which variables are accessible based on their access modifier

	Create a package access.b
	Create a class Mac in package access.b
		inherit the Computer class
		make a main method and create a Mac object. Check to see which variables are accessible

	Create a RunnerB in package access.b
		make a main method and create a Mac object. Check to see which variables are accessible

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

OlympicSport [Inheritance, overriding, super constructor, static]

	Create a class OlympicSport

		instance variables
			- name (String)
			- participants (int)

		static variable: year of first Olympics: 1896

		constructor:
			- initialize all fields

		methods:
			- compete()
		-> override compete in sub classes

		 - override toString()

	- Create a class Surfing

		child class of OlympicSport

		constructor: set name and participants variables

		methods:
			compete(): Print Surfing the waves

	- Create a class Track

		child class of OlympicSport

		constructor: set name and participants variables

		methods:
			compete(): Print Track for running, jumping, throwing

	- Create a class Soccer

		child class of OlympicSport

		constructor: set name and participants variables

		methods:
			compete(): Print Playing a soccer game

DiscordUser [Inheritance, overriding, super constructor, LocalDate]

	Create an DiscordUser class

	    - create variables:
	        role, name, id
	        variable: account creation date

	    - create constructor to initialize the variables

	    - create a method sendMessage()
	    	prints: "Sending message to class chat"

	    - create a method joinDiscord(String discordUrl)
	    	prints: "Joining $discordUrl"

	    - override toString()

	Create a class Admin

	    - Admin class inherits DiscordUser class

	    - create constructor to call parent constructor and set up variables (role - Admin, name, id)

	    - create method:
	        createChannel()
	            Example output: prints Creating new discord channel

	    - override the sendMessage() to print: "Sending announcement"

	Create a class Student

	    - Student class inherits DiscordUser class

	    - create constructor to call parent constructor and set up variables (role - Student, name, id)

	    - overload the sendMessage(String name) to accept a String for the chat name
	    	print Sending message to $name
