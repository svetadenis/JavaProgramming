do while loop

    similar to the while loop but the first iteration/execution is always run at least one time and then the boolean value is checked

	    do{
	        // statements
	    } while(boolean_expression);

        flow:
        	statements are executed * for do while the statement run once before checking the boolean
            boolean expression is checked
                if the boolean is true: the loop will run the next iteration, run statements. Then the boolean is checked again.

                if the boolean is false: the loop will stop
_________________________________________________________________

Difference between the loops

	while: used when the number of iterations is not known

	do while: used when the number of iterations is not known, but needs one guaranteed execution

	for loop: used when the number of iterations is known
__________________________________________________________________

nested loop

	Loop inside of a loop

		- the nested loop can be any loop type, but we commonly use for loop
			for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
				for(int j=0; j < 2; j++){
					System.out.println(i + " " + j);
				}
			}

			The outer loop ( first loop using the i variable ) will execute for a total of 5 iterations

			The inner loop ( second loop, which inside of the other loop ) will execute for a total of 10.
				-> for each iteration of the outer loop the inner loop starts from the beginning and executes until the end

class & object

	What is a class?

	    a template/blueprint for objects
	    classes are made in java file
	    the public classes should match the java file name

	What is an object?
	    instances of the class, so it has access to the variables/methods

	How to create an object?
	    ClassName referenceName = new ClassName();

	    instantiation: creating an object
	        in-stan-shi-ation

	What is an instance variable?
	    variables defined in a class. There variables belong to each object of the class
	    Every object has its own set of instance variables and instance methods

	instance methods
		do not have static in them
		they are accessed from the object of a class
__________________________________________________________________

toString
	this method is called automatically when you print an object

	DONT WORRY ABOUT @OVERRIDE RIGHT NOW - we will learn more about this later
__________________________________________________________________

this
	reference to the instance of the class

	this is mainly used to differentiate between local variables and instance variables

Java prioritizes local variables
    if there is a local variable and an instance variable that have the same name the local variable is the one used
