Practice Tasks

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

TrafficLight [encapsulation]

    Create a class Traffic Light

    instance variable: color (String)

    the constructor should call the setter method

    encapsulate the class
        the setter: only set the color if it is green, red, or yellow

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cities [encapsulation, class, object, static, Scanner, ArrayList]

    copy the given text file with city information into your project
    the information is given in this format with each information separated by a comma
        city name,growth rate,population,state

    create a class City
    encapsulated instance variables:
        city name, growth rate, population, state
    create a constructor to initialize all the variables
    create a toString of all the information

    create a class Database
    create a static variable: data (ArrayList of City)
    create a static block and read the information from the file
    while reading the information from the text file create City objects and add them into the ArrayList of Cities
    -> look back to day 10 for using Scanner to read a file

    create a Runner class to interact with the data
        filter by state
        filter by city names started with a specific letter
        filter cities by their growth rate
        filter cities by their population

DrinksVending [challenge] [class & object, encapsulation, ArrayList, Scanner, loops, methods]

	We will create program that will allow you to select a Drink from the vending machine.

	1) Create a Drink class:
		create instance variables: name, price, quantity
        encapsulate the class
		create a constructor to initialize all the variables
		create a toString to display the information cleanly

	2) Create a DrinkVending class:
		create instance variables: revenue, allDrinks (ArrayList of Drink objects)
		create a no arg constructor that will create an empty ArrayList
		create an overloaded constructor that will accept an ArrayList of Drinks of objects to initialize the vending machine with some Drinks
		create a toString to display the drinks in a nice format

        create a private method getDrink with a String name parameter and Drink return type
            check if the vending machine has the drink that is being check based on the given name
            return the Drink object if the drink is in the vending machine
            otherwise return null if the Drink could not be found

        create a method vend that will accept a String for the Drink name
            if the drink is in the vending machine and is in stock return the Drink object. also reduce the quantity of the that Drink by 1
            otherwise return null if the Drink could not be found


	   create a method stock that will accept an ArrayList of Drinks to fill the vending machine
            if it is a new Drink add it into vending machine
            otherwise if the Drink is already in the vending machine increase the quantity by amount being added

	3) Create a new class and test everything: Drink objects, DrinkVending object, constructors, stock & vend methods
