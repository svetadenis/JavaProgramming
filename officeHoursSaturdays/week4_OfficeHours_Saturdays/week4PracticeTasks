		if your sales amount is less than 10000 you don't get any bonus

		if your sales amount is more than or equal to 10000 and less than 15000 you get a bonus of 5000

		if your sales amount is more than or equal to 15000 you get a bonus of 7000

		print your bonus number

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Language [switch]

	Declare and assign a language variable
	Based on the language selected print the related message:

	English: hello, thank for your call
	Spanish: hola, gracias para llamar
	Turkish: merhaba, aradiginiz icin tesekkurler
	Russian: privet, spasibo za vash zvonok
	French: Merci, pour votre appel
	Any other input: sorry, $given_language not supported

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel [scanner, conditional, operators]

	Create a program that will allow you to check into a hotel. When checking in some information will be gathered and used to determine the information about the room and price

	Go through the following flow:

		Welcome to the Java Hotel
		How many days will you stay
		-> read number of days from console
		How many people are in your party
		-> read number of people from console

	In addition declare these variables:
		price, room type

	Use the information gathered to assign a room to the guests and print the information

	Data:

		people 1 | single room | price: number of days staying * 100
		people 2 | double room | price: number of days staying * 125
		people 3 or 4 | large room | price: number of days staying * number of people * 50
		people 5 or 6 | suite | price: number of days staying * 1000

		any other number of people is invalid and should output:
			sorry $number_of_people is not a valid group size

Penny Machine [challenge] [variables, operators, conditional statements, Scanner]

    Create a program that will allow the user to convert their cents(pennies) into dollars, quarters, dimes, & nickles. Note: I am trying to convert my cents into the biggest types possible, like getting change back. Not how many of each I can make

    Pseudocode guide:
        1) define the total number of cents, these are all pennies at the beginning
        2) define all the currency types I can use: dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and left over pennies
        3) I will start with the biggest type I can return, which is dollars. I will determine how many cents are in a dollar. Knowing the number of cents in a dollar will allow me to reduce a big amount of the cents into dollars
        4) after calculating the number of dollars I can make I will find the left over cents that couldn't fit into a dollar
        5) I will look at the next biggest currency type, which is quarters. I will see how many of my cents can fit into a quarter value
        6) after calculating the number of quarters I will remove that many cents from my total cents
        7) I will then repeat those steps for dimes and nickels to check how many of my cents can be represented as dimes and nickels
        8) any left over cents will be my left over pennies
        9) display all dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles and pennies I was able to get back from my initial cents amount

    Bonus: make it dynamic with Scanner input. Check that cents are above 0
    Bonus: only display the currency types that were needed. For example if I had 0 dimes then don't display it in the final result
