from last week
SumDigits [Wrapper class, ArrayList, loop]

    Create a program that will define an ArrayList of String. The elements in this ArrayList will be number digits like: "123". Calculate the sum of the digits and store them into a new ArrayList of Integers. Print all the sums of the digits at the end.

        Ex:
            Input:
            ["123, "52", "513"]
            Output:
            [6, 7, 9]
Filter Characters [ArrayList, Wrapper class, loop, boolean]

    Create a program that will have a String of different characters, of different types. Filter(group) all the digits, letters, and special characters

        ex:
            String str = "abcd@!#$etyi123lkjhaqwer%^&879";
            digits: 123879
            letters: abcdetyilkjhaqwer
            special: @!#$%^&

Food [class, object, constructor, array]
    create a class called Food
        define these instance variables
            name, quantity, unit price, total price

       constructors
            - create a constructor that creates a Food object with the name
            - create a constructor that creates a Food object with the name and quantity
            - create a constructor that creates a Food object with the name, quantity, and unit price
                -> call calculatePrice() method here

       methods:
            - calculatePrice(): multiple the quantity by unit price and assign the value to the total price
            - toString()
                return all the Food information

    Create a separate class to create and test the Food objects
        try making an array of Food objects
        find all the Food objects that start with 'a' and print the Food object
        find all the Food objects that have a total price over 20 and print the name of the food

Date Time Tasks [LocalDate, DateTimeFormatter]

    - get the current day and find out what the date will be in 130 days
    - ask the users to enter their birthday and calculate what day of the week their next birthday will be on
    - define the times a store is open and check if you can visit the store at your current time

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Encryption [class, instance, static, methods, loop, String, constructor]

    Create a class Encryption

    define these instance variables
        message (String)
        modify number
        factor number

    create a constructor that will initialize the message
    create a constructor that will initialize the message, modify number, and factor number
        call the encrypt method here

    create a toString method that will only print the message variable

    create a method encrypt (instance)
        return: void
        parameters: none

        To encrypt every character of the message we will take the modified number and add it to ascii value of each character. Then we will multiply the result by the factor number. After encrypting reassign the encrypted version into the message variable

        Ex:
            message = "james bond"
            modify num: 20
            factor num: 2

            message: 252 234 258 242 270 104 236 262 260 240

    create a method decrypt (static)
        return: String
        parameters: message, modify number, factor number

        Given the modify and factor numbers decrypt the message and return the decrypted String. Do the reverse steps we did for encrypting

        Ex:
        message: 252 234 258 242 270 104 236 262 260 240
        modify num: 20
        factor num: 2

        -> james bond

ShowTracker [challenge] [classes, constructors, ArrayList, LocalDate]

    Create a class Show
        define these instance variables
            name
            number of seasons
            release date
            boolean completed
                true - finished
                false - ongoing
            audio languages available (String ArrayList)

    create a constructor that will initialize all the variables

    create a toString to display all the information about the Show

        ------------------------------------------------

    Create a class ShowTracker

        define these instance variables:
            username
            password
            tracked shows (ArrayList of Show objects)

    create a constructor that will initialize all the variables

    create method trackShow(Show)
        this method will accept a Show object. Check if the show is already tracked and if it is not add it to the list of shows

    create a method filter(String)
        return all the shows that are available in the defined language
            ex: filter("english") -> returns all the shows that can be viewed in English

    overload the method to accept a boolean argument filter(boolean)
        if the boolean is true return the list of shows that are complete
        if the boolean is false return the list of shows that are ongoing
            ex: filter(true) -> return all the shows that are complete

    overload the method to accept a LocalDate argument filter(LocalDate)
        return all the shows after the defined date

    create a toString to display the show tracker information

        ------------------------------------------------

    Sample data to use, or create your own

    name - number of seasons - release date - completed - available languages

    the last of us - 1 - January 15, 2023 - false - english, spanish
    game of thrones - 8 - April 17, 2011 - true - english, spanish, german
    family feud - 24 - July 12, 1976 - false - english
