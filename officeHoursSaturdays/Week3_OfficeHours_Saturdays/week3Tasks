Practice Tasks:

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Balance [single if, operators, variables]

	Declare and assign the following variables
		amount balance & withdraw amount

    Check the balance after the withdrawal
        if you withdrew more money that you had in the account add a overdraft fee to the balance by subtracting 100

    In both cases print the remaining balance after withdrawing

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lockdown [if else]

	Declare and assign a year variable

	Using the year determine if we were on lockdown and activities done on a daily basis

		if the year was 2020 or 2021 print:
			Stay at home
			Practice java
			Wear a mask

		if the year was any other year print:
			Party
			Practice Java
			Travel

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overtime [if else, operators, variables]

	Declare and assign the following variables
		hourly rate & number of hours worked

	Calculate your total net pay for the week. Also consider if any overtime should be paid. Overtime will be 1.5 times the normal rate and should be paid for every hour over 40.
	(if you worked 43 hours total, you will get 40 hours normal pay and 3 hours overtime pay)

	Output different messages based on overtime
		if normal hours were worked (40 hours or less):
			You worked $hours hours, so your total net pay is: $netPay

		if you worked overtime (more than 40 hours):
			Wow you worked $hours hours so you will get $overtime_hours of overtime. Your net pay is $netPay

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diving [multibranch]

	Declare and assign a oxygen tank level. This level will be a whole number percentage, so 80 would represent 80% oxygen

	Check how much oxygen is left in the tank and output a corresponding message

		use these ranges:
			100 - 90: Your tank is full
			89 - 80: A lot left to use
			79 - 70: Don't go too far
			69 - 60: Start to head back
			59 - 50: Be careful now you at at 50%
			Less than 50: Critical

{IQ} Finra [multibranch, operators]

	Create a program that will print the given number. But if the number is a multiple of 3 print "FIN" instead of the number. If the number is a multiple of 5 print "RA" instead of the number. And if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 print "FINRA" instead of the number

		ex:
			number: 3
			output: FIN

			number: 10
			output: RA

			number: 15
			output: FINRA

			number: 7
			output: 7

	Hint: you will be checking for divisibility, so you will need to use the % operator
