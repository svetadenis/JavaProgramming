    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currency Converter [methods, conditional, operators]

	create a method that will accept a currency type(String) and a currency amount (double)[as dollars] and convert the currency from dollars to a different type. return the converted number

	Use the following sample rates for currency conversions
		1 dollar = 0.91 euro
		1 dollar = 121.03 yen
		1 dollar = 14.85 lira
		1 dollar = 1,217.52 won
		1 dollar = 181.45 rupee

	Note: Don't worry about decimal formats, focus on the code to create these conversions

	Follow up: think about how this method could be improved

		Ex:
			Input: euro, 100
			Output: 91

		Ex:
			Input: yen, 50
			Output: 6051.5

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplication Table [methods, loops, operators]

	create a method that will accept a number. Print the multiplication table for the give number up until 10

	print the results in this format:
		$number x 1 = result
		$number x 2 = result
		...
		$number x 10 = result

		ex:
			number = 4
			4 x 1 = 4
			4 x 2 = 8
			...

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplication Table II [methods, overloading, loops, operators]

	overload the previous multiplication table method to accept the number for the table and also the ending point for the multiplication(the default was before was 10)

		ex: inputs: 3, 20
			result would print the multiplication table of 3 up until 20
				3 x 1 = 3
				...
				3 x 20 = 60

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bot [while, Scanner, conditional]

	create a program that will make a simple bot that can talk with the user. when the program runs the user will be able to continue typing to the bot. Based on what the user says the bot will say something back. Use the following sample set up, but be creative and add more to the bot

	user says | > bot responds

	hello | > world
	what is your age | > I was programmed in 2023
	who created you | > I was created by Saim (use your name)
	what can we talk about | > print a menu of the options the bot can respond to

	off | > haha you cannot turn me off I am invincible
	shutdown | > SHUTTING DOWN (program ends, user cannot type anymore)

	bonus: keep track how many times you interacted with the bot
	bonus: keep a log of the conversation

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

[IQ] Palindrome [method, String, loop]

	create a method that will accept a String and return a boolean. Determine if the given String is a palindrome.
	A palindrome is when the characters being read from the beginning match the characters being read from the end. In other words, the reverse order of the word is the same as the original word order

		Ex:
			racecar
			true

			anna
			true

			abc
			false

			abcba
			true

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Count Hi [method, loop, String]

	create a method that will accept a String and count how many times the word "hi" is found in the String. return the count

		ex:
			input: aahiahiaaahh
			output: 2
				"hi" was found 2 times

			input: ahhhbchidefhihellohiiiiworld
			output: 3
				"hi" was found 3 times

	extra: overload the method to search for any word, not just "hi"
