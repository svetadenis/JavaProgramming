--What is Avengers sessions and who should join  ?
        Avengers sessions are additional hours will be in a very relaxed pace.If you understand the regular topics,
        and if you are able to solve the practices we do not suggest you to join to this session. However, if you
        feel like you need help when you are practicing solo even after you joined to live classes and the office
        hours, this session is here to help you to guide through some additional practices in a slow but steady pace.

-- Is any preparation required before the sessions?
        I will share the practice program for each week in the "arthur_only" channel on Discord couple of days before
         the sessions. To make our sessions more productive, I encourage you to review the week's Codingbat practices
          before our session.

--What is the appropriate behavior expected during class?
        -First of all follow the class carefully
        -If you would like to catch the important point of topic just listen, do not try to write codes yourself
        -I will share all codes in GitHub
        -If you would like to write your codes simultaneously with your instructor  while listening you can try
        both watch the recordings of these classes and write your own codes together. If you succeed that you can
        do the same during the classes. If you can not do not worry that is absolutely normal just take small notes
        -During the class if you have any question note that and wait for your question, if you try to type your
        question while I am telling maybe you can miss the point of topic
        -I will answer all questions. If our class time is not enough for all question , I will give you extra time.
        -If you have an error, do not panic, just read the ERRORS from Console

-- To test/run any of the methods in IntelliJ you need to:
       -First create a main method
       -Then copy your codes from codingbat to IntelliJ
       -Then make the custom method static
       -And then call the your custom method inside main method and give appropriate arguments


--If Statements: used for conditional statements. if the condition true, the block gets executed

    Single if: for one condition

        if(Condition){
            StatementA
        }

    If & else: when there are only two option/possibilities ( not more not less than 2 condition)


        if(Condition){
            StatementA
        }else{ // otherwise
            StatementB
        }

        StatementA: if condition MUST be true
        StatementB: if condition MUST be false

    Multi-branch if: when there are three or more options/possibilities

        if(Condition1){
            StatementA
        }else if(Condition2){
            StatementB
        }else{
            StatementC
        }

        ONLY one block gets executed

        StatementA: Condition1 MUST be true
        StatementB: Condition1 MUST be false, Condition2 MUST be true
        StatementC: Condition1 & Condition2 MUST be false

--Ternaries: shortcut of if statement

    if:        (Condition)?
    else:                 :
    else if:   :(Condition)?
