T4HouseMarket [switch, variables]

You are buying a new house and need to collect information about the houses in a specific neighborhood

	create a program that will declare and define the neighborhood name and based on the name return a report of the houses in that area. The report should include this information: the average house price, rating of school districts near by(out of 5), if it is a gated community or not, and if pets are allowed

	print the final report in this format:
		$the houses in the $neighborhood_name on average value at $average_price. This neighborhood $is_gated_or_not and the rating of the school distracts near by is $school_rating out of 5. For the pet owners you $are_or_not in luck because pets are $allowed_or_not_allowed

		Note: for simple use you can print true or false in the gated and pets parts, but for a challenge try to print the message with as many dynamic parts as possible

	Data to use:

		name - Hills
		average price - 89,000
		rating - 4.0
		gated - no
		allow pets - yes

		name - Oaks

T5Converter [switch, Scanner, variables, operators]

	create a program that can help the user convert between different unit types. Create a menu that will show the options by numbers (ie 1. inches to centimeters), so if the user picks 1 it will be converting from inches to centimeters. After asking for the conversion operation ask the user the value for the base number (in this example inches)

	sample menu:
		1. inches to centimeters		[formula: inches * 2.54]
		2. pounds to kilograms			[formula: pounds * 0.454]
		3. fahrenheit to celsius		[formula: (fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8]
		4. feet to meters			    [formula: feet * 0.3048]
